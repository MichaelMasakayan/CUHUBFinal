3. A DESCRIPTION Of the website
a. A major concern of clubs is getting participants to join their events. However, even with the proactive advertising by members, the invitations may not be acknowledged in the shuffle of university life. In comes a hub for clubs to advertise directly to members as well as lay out when these events are happening. This makes it easier on the side of the participants to not only plan on attending events but to also receive further information on events without the need of QRcodes.
